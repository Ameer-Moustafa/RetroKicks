            In the 1960s, Converse released their classic Chuck Taylors in
            bright colors for the athletes that wanted to match their shoes to
            their team colors. The new ability to rep your team colors made
            Converse the most popular shoe of the '60s.

            In the '70s, Nike released the first pair of Nike Cortex sneakers.
            Coincidentally, they were also one of the first styles from the
            brand to have the iconic swoosh logo. The sneaker was seen on
            athletes and celebrities alike, including Farrah Fawcett in the 1976
            show Charlie's Angels.
