            In the 1960s, Converse released their classic Chuck Taylors in
            bright colors for the athletes that wanted to match their shoes to
            their team colors. The new ability to rep your team colors made
            Converse the most popular shoe of the '60s.

            In the '70s, Nike released the first pair of Nike Cortex sneakers.
            Coincidentally, they were also one of the first styles from the
            brand to have the iconic swoosh logo. The sneaker was seen on
            athletes and celebrities alike, including Farrah Fawcett in the 1976
            show Charlie's Angels.

            In 1985, Nike released the Air Jordan sneaker as part of a deal with
            then-Chicago Bulls player Michael Jordan. In just two months, Nike
            sold $70 million worth of the sneakers, which skyrocketed even
            further after Jordan won Rookie of the Year that same year.

            The most popular Vans shoe in 2000 was the Vans Slip-On. This
            classic style, originally released in 1977, was iconic for its
            simple design and canvas upper. It featured a low profile, slip-on
            silhouette, with a padded collar for added comfort. The shoe was
            available in a range of colors, favored by skaters and celebrities
            alike.

            Dubbed the “Roshe killer” by Ye, the adidas Yeezy Boost 350 comes
            equipped with innovative technology. The upper utilizes adidas’
            Primeknit and features an ultra-comfortable Boost cushioning system.
            Its sock-like fit was perfect for the era in which it was created,
            as the Ultraboost and NMD dominated sneaker culture, and has since
            become a staple of the sneaker scene.
